MITRE ATT&CK Navigator Examples

This repository contains two examples created using the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator. These visualizations were developed as part of my thesis work on the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.
Overview

The repository includes:

    Sandworm vs APT28: A comparative visualization highlighting the tactics and techniques attributed to Sandworm and APT28.
    NoTpetya: A detailed visualization of the techniques involved in the NoTpetya attack.

Each example is represented as an ATT&CK Navigator layer file (JSON format) that can be loaded into the Navigator tool for further analysis and visualization.
Repository Contents

    sandworm_vs_apt28.json – MITRE ATT&CK Navigator layer for comparing Sandworm and APT28 activities.
    notpetya.json – MITRE ATT&CK Navigator layer for the NoTpetya attack.
    README.md – This file, explaining the repository contents and usage.

How to Use

    Install MITRE ATT&CK Navigator:
    If you haven’t already, download and set up the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator from the official repository.

    Load a Layer:
        Open the Navigator.
        Click on "Load Layer".
        Select the JSON file (either sandworm_vs_apt28.json or notpetya.json) to view the visualization.

    Explore the Visualizations:
    Use the Navigator’s interface to interact with the layer, examine the techniques used in each scenario, and analyze the differences between the attack profiles.

Thesis Context

This repository is part of my thesis research on the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. The examples provided illustrate how different threat groups and attack campaigns can be visualized and compared using the Navigator tool.
