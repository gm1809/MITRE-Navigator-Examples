Creating Examples via MITRE ATT&CK Navigator

This document outlines the steps to create two examples using the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator: one comparing Sandworm vs APT28 and another for NoTpetya.
Prerequisites

    MITRE ATT&CK Navigator: Ensure you have the Navigator tool set up. You can download it from the official GitHub repository.
    MITRE ATT&CK Framework Data: Familiarize yourself with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and have access to the data for relevant tactics and techniques.

This document outlines the steps to create two examples using the web-based MITRE ATT&CK Navigator platform: one comparing Sandworm vs APT28 and another for NoTpetya.
Prerequisites

    Access the Web-Based Navigator:
    Navigate to the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator web application. No local installation is required.
    MITRE ATT&CK Framework Data:
    Familiarize yourself with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and review the tactics and techniques available.

Steps to Create the Examples
1. Access the Navigator

    Open your web browser and go to the [MITRE ATT&CK Navigator.](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/)

2. Create a New Layer File

    Click on "New Layer" to open a blank visualization workspace.
    This layer will be used to map out your attack scenarios.

3. Identify and Map Techniques
Sandworm vs APT28 Example:

    Research Techniques:
    Identify the techniques associated with both Sandworm and APT28 from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
    Mapping:
    In the Navigator, assign different colors or markers to techniques used by Sandworm and those used by APT28.
    Comparison:
    Highlight overlapping and distinct techniques to illustrate the similarities and differences between the two threat groups.

NoTpetya Example:

    Research Techniques:
    Identify the key tactics and techniques involved in the NoTpetya attack.
    Mapping:
    Create a new layer and mark the techniques with unique identifiers (e.g., color codes or scores) to reflect their role or impact in the attack.

4. Customize Layer Details

    Title and Description:
    Provide clear titles and descriptions for each example directly in the Navigator interface.
    Additional Notes:
    Utilize the "Notes" section to document insights or context that support your analysis.

5. Save Your Work

    Once your visualization is complete, use the Navigator’s "Export" feature to save your layer as a JSON file.
    Save the files with descriptive names (e.g., sandworm_vs_apt28.json and notpetya.json).

6. Validate and Test

    Load the Layer:
    Use the Navigator’s "Load Layer" function to verify that your exported JSON files display correctly.
    Review and Adjust:
    Make any necessary adjustments to ensure your examples accurately reflect the research and analysis.
