Creating Examples via MITRE ATT&CK Navigator

This document outlines the steps to create two examples using the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator: one comparing Sandworm vs APT28 and another for NoTpetya.
Prerequisites

    MITRE ATT&CK Navigator: Ensure you have the Navigator tool set up. You can download it from the official GitHub repository.
    MITRE ATT&CK Framework Data: Familiarize yourself with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and have access to the data for relevant tactics and techniques.

Steps to Create the Examples
1. Set Up the Navigator Environment

    Clone or download the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator from GitHub.
    Launch the Navigator in your browser by opening the index.html file.

2. Create a New Layer File

    In the Navigator interface, click "New Layer".
    This opens a blank layer where you can start adding your visualizations.

3. Identify and Map Techniques
Sandworm vs APT28 Example:

    Research Techniques: Identify techniques used by both Sandworm and APT28 using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
    Mapping: In the layer, assign different colors or annotations to techniques attributed to Sandworm and those attributed to APT28.
    Comparison: Highlight overlapping techniques as well as differences between the two groups.

NoTpetya Example:

    Research Techniques: Identify the tactics and techniques involved in the NoTpetya attack.
    Mapping: In a new layer, mark the techniques using the Navigator’s built-in tools. Use a distinct color or score to indicate the level of involvement or risk.

4. Customize Layer Details

    Title and Description: Provide a clear title and description for each example within the Navigator interface.
    Additional Notes: Use the “Notes” section to add any additional context or commentary that supports your analysis.

5. Save Your Layer Files

    After completing the visualization for each example, click "Export" to save the layer as a JSON file.
    Name the files appropriately (e.g., sandworm_vs_apt28.json and notpetya.json).

6. Validate and Test

    Load the Layer: Use the Navigator’s "Load Layer" feature to verify that your JSON files render correctly.
    Review and Adjust: Make any necessary adjustments to ensure the visualizations accurately reflect your research.
